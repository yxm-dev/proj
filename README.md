The following is a list of projects related to software development that I'm involved. For a small list with
programs in which I have been working in, please see [here](https://yxm.me/dev/list). For projects related
to research, see [here](https://yxm.me/res/proj). 

* *modular and OOP `Bash`*: I work with `Bash` scripts all the time. Actually, I think that `Bash` is poorly
  explored as a programming language. To improve my experience in creating and reusing scripts, I plan to
  simulate some modularity and OOP features in `Bash`.
* `inTui`: I really like to work in a terminal emulator. At the same time, I recognize that for the beginner 
  Linux user it can be a bit scaring to adopt a command line approach. Thus, I'm developing a series of scripts 
  and `Bash` functions aimed to provide a smooth transition from GUI to CLI.
* *DevOps `collab`*: This started as a personal project where I was collecting answers to my daily questions 
  concerning Linux and software development. However, I think that this has the potential of being a 
  collaborative project where people could add question and answers related to practical stuff, focused on 
  Open Source tools, programming languages and DevOps technologies. The idea is to be a public git repository.
* *learning platform*: I realized that there is a lack of good courses about programming that provide a solid
  background and, at the same time, that were created by individuals who have genuine experience and validated 
  education in the field of teaching. Currently I'm involved in covering this gap.
